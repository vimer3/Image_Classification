🍛 Indian Dish Classification with Deep Learning 🇮🇳

This project focuses on classifying images of Indian dishes using deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

🔑 ** Key Components:**

1️⃣ **Data Preparation and Exploration:** 🧹📊
We cleaned and organized the dataset, balancing the number of images per class and visualizing examples of Indian dishes.

2️⃣ **CNN Model Implementation:** 🧠🔬
We developed and compared three neural network architectures:

* AlexNet
* LeNet
* GoogleNet

3️⃣ **Data Augmentation:** 🔄🖼️
To improve model performance, we applied data augmentation techniques, including horizontal flips, rotations, color modifications, and sharpness adjustments.

4️⃣ **Performance Evaluation:** 📈🏆
We evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy and visualized results with confusion matrices.

5️⃣ **Practical Applications:** 💡🍽️
We explored potential uses for the algorithm, such as automatic price allocation in a buffet, food allergen detection, and dietary analysis.
